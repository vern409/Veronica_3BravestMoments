          <p class="lead">In 2008 my grandpa had to get heart surgery. I was only seven at the time but I still remember that day very clearly. My whole family waited patiently and nervously while he was getting the sugery. We were pacing and sitting in the bland waiting room. After a couple of hours we got a call from the doctor, which is a good thing, and he said that the surgery was all done and that it went well. We all had a sigh of relief. </p>

          <p class="lead">In 2008 my aunts was diagnosed with Leukkemia. My whole family was shocked and saddened by the news, but we made sure to support her and eachother. After a couple of months she went into remission, which means she was cancer free. Unfortunately the cancer was back a couple months later. We spent many nights and days in the hospital. In 2010 she reacieved a stem cell transplant. Therefore, she was cancer free once more. Doctors believe that you are officially cured from cancer after being in remission for five years, and in 2015 my aunt reached those 5 years!   </p>

          <p class="lead">In 2015 I started high school. From Pre-K to 8th grade I went to the same public school, so I was very nervous to start. The new school I was going to was very different from my old school. This school was private and much smaller than my old school. I went from a school that had over 1,000 students to a school that had around 50 students. In addition, the learning model and curriculum was very different. Therefore, I was scared I would not be as successful. To my surprise I liked my new school very much and I was very successful. Not only was I successful but I also became a lot more confident and open. I was no longer the shy person I was before. I am very happy of the changes that came about with this new school.</p>
